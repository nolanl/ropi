Prepare a read-only raspbian image.

$ ./prepimg PATH_TO_RASPBIAN_IMG
$ ./piemu PATH_TO_RASPBIAN_IMG
  Wait, then kill qemu with "Ctrl-a x" when it fails to reboot
  May have to run "reset" if qemu left the terminal in a bad state.
$ ./piemu PATH_TO_RASPBIAN_IMG
  Set root passwd for serial console login, if desired: "sudo passwd root"
  Login ropi/ropi and run "sudo /boot/postboot.sh"
  Shutdown: "sudo shutdown -h now"
$ ./piemu PATH_TO_RASPBIAN_IMG
  Any other customization (don't forget to "/root/makerw" first).
  Shutdown.
  Flash image to SDcard.

#XXX Why does raspbian hang while rebooting itself after resizing the rootfs?

#XXX Try:
# add "systemd.run" magic to cmdline.txt to run postboot.sh
# postboot.sh removes systemd.run before it deletes itself.
